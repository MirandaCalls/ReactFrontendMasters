All React code under the hood consists of calling React.createElement to create trees of UI structure that can be rendered on a various set of platforms:
* HTML Dom
* Native Mobile
* Desktop
```jsx
const Pet = (props) => {
    return (
        React.createElement("div", {}, [
            React.createElement("h1", {}, props.name),
            React.createElement("h2", {}, props.animal),
            React.createElement("h2", {}, props.breed),
        ])
    );
}
```

.render() is only ever called 1 time in a React application
```jsx
ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById("root"));
```

Children cannot affect the parent, so any bugs in the parent will rule out the issue occuring anywhere else.
```jsx
const App = () => {
    return React.createElement(
        "div",
        {}, // Empty object is props given as a parameter to child component
        [
            React.createElement("h1", {id: "brand"}, "Adopt Me!"),
            React.createElement(Pet, {name: "Catherine", animal: "Cat", breed: "Mix"}),
            React.createElement(Pet, {name: "Miles", animal: "Cat", breed: "Siamese"}),
            React.createElement(Pet, {name: "Lady", animal: "Cat", breed: "Long Hair"}),
        ]
    );
}
```
* Data given to child "components" is specified using an object referred to as "props".
